Our project consists of a smart library for students where they can submit educational resources in exchange for tokens i.e cryptocurrency contributions. These tokens can then be used in order to acquire new educational materials supplemented by other users in the library. The main goal is to allow for the exchange of knowledge in a secure and traceable manner. This marketplace enables higher-quality materials to naturally rise to the top of the most coveted items in the library.
